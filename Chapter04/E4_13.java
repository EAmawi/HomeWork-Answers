  E4.13 Write a program that reads a number between 1,000 and 999,999 from the user,
  * where the user enters a comma in the input. Then print the number without a comma.
  * Here is a sample dialog; the user input is in color:Please enter an integer between 1,000 and 999,999: 
  * 23,45623456Hint: Read the input as a string. Measure the length of the string. Suppose it contain characters.
  * Then extract substrings consisting of the first n â€“ 4 characters and the last three characters.
